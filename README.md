# Homework Assignment w/Bootstrap



## In this submission I have made a mobile responsive website with bootstrap. 

All pages can be resized. I concentrated on overriding classes and nested classes in bootstrap with css.

## Content
1. Index
2. Contact
3. Portfolio>Rock Paper Scissors assignment [rps.html]


## Responsiveness
Please note the footer hides on a mobile screen because I used a media query. This was intentional to reduce clutter and keep the mobile website minimal.

## Animations
The navbar has an animated text colour(it glows), I included this to play with animation features in CSS before moving onto JS Animations

## Design
colours.png in the assets file


## Room for Improvement
* Understanding the use of float & clear in CSS
* Using Js for animations and website interactive buttons
* As the website is a black theme, in the future I will use a button to change the website to a white themed website.
